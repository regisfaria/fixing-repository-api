# Repository API Fixing
  
## Overview 
 This is a code challenge where I was given a working API, but with some programming bugs, code needing to be finished and some other little tricks.

 My objective was to fix this API and pass on the tests inside **src/__tests__/**.

## Instalation & Running
Just install project dependencies with:
```shell
yarn
```

then run the server with:
```shell
yarn dev
```

you can run tests with:
```shell
yarn test
```
